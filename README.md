# Backtracking in Java

This repository contains Java implementations of various backtracking algorithms. Backtracking is a powerful algorithmic technique used to solve problems by trying out different possibilities, discarding those that lead to dead-ends, and finding a valid solution eventually. The goal of this repository is to provide clean, well-documented, and efficient Java code for different backtracking problems.

## Introduction

Backtracking is a systematic approach that explores all possible solutions to a problem by constructing partial solutions and then incrementally building upon them until a valid solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted. It is commonly used in various problem domains, such as finding a path in a maze, solving Sudoku puzzles, and many more.

This repository aims to provide easy-to-understand Java implementations of backtracking algorithms, along with explanations and examples for each problem. The code is organized and structured in a way that promotes readability, modularity, and efficiency.

## Backtracking Algorithms

The following backtracking algorithms are currently implemented in this repository:

1. **Find Permutations**: Generating all possible permutations of a given array of elements.

2. **Find Subsets**: Finding all possible subsets of a given set of elements.

3. **Grid Ways**: Counting all possible ways to traverse a 2D grid from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.

4. **N-Queens Problem**: Solving the classic N-Queens problem, where you have to place N queens on an NxN chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

5. **Sudoku Solver**: A program that solves a given Sudoku puzzle using backtracking to fill in the empty cells.
